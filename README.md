<!-- Introduction -->
<h2>Welcome to the Kjeledyr Webapp</h2>

<p>
  💻 This webapp was created as preparation for my DATA1700 exam at OsloMet in 2022. As a second-semester computer engineering student, I have learned a variety of programming languages and technologies, including Java, Spring, Jquery, Bootstrap, Vanilla JS, AJAX, JSON, and SQL. 
</p>

<p>
  💡 With this project, I wanted to demonstrate my knowledge and ability to bring together all the tools and concepts I have learned so far.

<!-- Main Functionality -->
<h3>Pet Registration</h3>

<p>
  🐶 The Kjeledyr Webapp is a simple platform where users can register their pets. The main page allows for either signing in with a previous account or creating a new one. 
</p>

<p>
  🔒 The login page is equipped with multiple security features, such as regex validation, password validation with bCrypt, and data search in the database. 
</p>

<p>
  📝 The registration page follows the same security measures as the login page, and also confirms if the username has already been taken and if the postal code is valid. 
</p>

<p>
  🐱 After logging in, users can proceed to add their pets. Only the admin user has the ability to delete or edit pet registrations, through session control.
